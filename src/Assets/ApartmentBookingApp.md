# Apartment Booking App

---

## Features

- Responsive/Adaptive Design
- _Material UI_ framework
- Efficent appartment fetching with _GraphQL_
- _MongoDB_ for scalability
- _Apollo_ as middleman between react client and express server
- Animations with real physics using _React Spring_
- Flexible apartment filter
- Synchronized with AirBNB and Booking calender which allows user to see available dates

## My role

Initial goal was to develop a web app that includes contact form, apartment listing page and great overview of apatments. And my role included the developement of front-end using react and back-end with express. Not to mention, as project was somewhat large, every feature needed to be presented and reviewed to stakeholder (as per SCRUM).

## Difficulties

The most challenging in the project was to implement **great apartment overview** as this required not only advanced software engineering skills but also designing. Even with _Material UI_ provided utilities and design solutions I couldn't think of some way to combine apartment location, description, features and other stats in merely one of 3X3 cards.
Then come **technology implementations on client-side** such as _GraphQL_ and _Apollo_ for which i did not have previous experience and which cause a bit more attention investment for code, but thanks to decent documentation I did not stumble on this task.
As far as **server-side** is concerned, _Typescript_ required me to dig more in order to find corresponding _types_ for each module which took some time but not drastically.
